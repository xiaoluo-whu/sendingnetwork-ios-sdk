 Dummy Swift file.
 
 Without a swift file in the SendingnetworkSDKTests bundle, Xcode won't be able
 to run the tests. If "Gather Coverage Data" is enabled, you will see an
 error message that says:
 
    Code Coverage Data Generation Failed
    Unable to retrieve the profile data files from <Device Name>
 
 THIS IS MISLEADING! The issue doesn't have anything to do with code
 coverage. In fact, if you disable "Gather Coverage Data", the task will
 fail silently.
 
 If you delete this Swift file, you may find that the tests continue to run
 without issues. DECEPTION! If another developer attempts to clone this
 repository without a swift file in the test bundle, the tests will not run!
